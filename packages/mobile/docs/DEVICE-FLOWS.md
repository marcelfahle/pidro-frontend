# Device flows — driving the simulator

Everything in `FIXTURE-ROUTES.md` gets you to a _state_. This gets you to an
_interaction_: tapping, typing and asserting on a real simulator, where safe
areas, touch targets and gestures are real. `WEB-PARITY.md` explains why the
browser tier cannot settle those.

Tooling is **Maestro** (mobile.dev). It drives the simulator with its own
XCUITest runner — no `idb`, no Appium server.

## Why Maestro and not idb

`idb` gives raw primitives (`tap x y`). Everything that makes a device loop
usable — find by label, wait for it to appear, retry when it doesn't — you
would build and debug yourself. Maestro ships that as the product, and its
selectors are accessibility labels, so flows survive layout changes.

It also needs no `brew trust` grant, and Java (its one dependency) is already
here.

## Install

**Not `brew install maestro`** — that name belongs to an unrelated product.

```bash
# Requires java (openjdk@17 is already installed here) and unzip.
curl -Ls https://get.maestro.mobile.dev | bash          # or, without piping to bash:
curl -fL -o /tmp/maestro.zip \
  https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/Maestro/releases/latest/download/maestro.zip
unzip -qo /tmp/maestro.zip -d /tmp/mx && mkdir -p ~/.maestro && cp -rf /tmp/mx/maestro/* ~/.maestro/
```

It lives entirely in `~/.maestro`. Remove with `rm -rf ~/.maestro`.

This machine's copy is **not on PATH** (the installer's shell-rc edit was
skipped), so call it by path or export it per shell:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.maestro/bin:$PATH"
```

## Run a flow

```bash
cd pidro_frontend/packages/mobile
just mobile                                    # Metro must be running
maestro --udid <UDID> test test/flows/seat-decisions.yaml
maestro list-devices                           # find the UDID
maestro hierarchy                              # dump what Maestro can see
```

Flows live in `test/flows/`. Screenshots do **not** land in the repo — they go
to `~/.maestro/tests/<timestamp>/<flow>/takeScreenshot/…`, and the path in
`takeScreenshot:` is a subpath under that.

## Writing a flow: the four things that will bite you

1. **`appId` is Expo Go**, not Pidro: `host.exp.Exponent`. The app under test
   is whatever Metro is serving. (A dev-client build would use its own id.)

2. **Always `- stopApp` before `- openLink`.** Opening a deep link for the
   route the app is _already on_ does not remount it — expo-router keeps the
   mounted screen and its params. A rerun would silently inherit the previous
   run's state and assert against it. This is the same staleness that makes
   `?state=` changes appear to do nothing on a warm app.

3. **Use `extendedWaitUntil`, not `assertVisible`, for anything that arrives.**
   A cold Metro bundle takes ~30s, and overlays animate in. A bare
   `assertVisible` races both and fails intermittently — which reads like a
   real regression.

   ```yaml
   - extendedWaitUntil:
       visible: 'Review seats (3)'
       timeout: 45000
   ```

4. **Selectors are accessibility labels**, so they are a product concern.
   `accessibilityLabel` on a primitive is what makes it addressable — the
   progression HUD's `RatingPlaque` exposes `Rating 1487`, `LeagueProgress`
   exposes its percentage. Run `maestro hierarchy` to see exactly what a screen
   offers before guessing.

## For agents: the MCP server

`.mcp.json` at the monorepo root registers Maestro as a project-scoped MCP
server, so an agent gets simulator control as first-class tools rather than
shelling out:

| Tool              | Use                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_devices`    | find the booted simulator                                 |
| `inspect_screen`  | the view hierarchy — **do this before writing selectors** |
| `run`             | run a flow or ad-hoc Maestro commands                     |
| `take_screenshot` | capture current state                                     |
| `cheat_sheet`     | Maestro's own command reference                           |

The `*_cloud_*` tools need a Maestro Cloud login and are not used here.

Working loop for an agent: `inspect_screen` to learn the real labels → write or
edit a flow in `test/flows/` → `run` it → `take_screenshot` to see the result.
Do not guess coordinates; tap by label.

## What belongs in a device flow

A device flow is expensive (a simulator, a Metro bundle, ~30s of startup).
Spend it only on what the browser tier genuinely cannot prove:

- Safe-area clearance and overlay collisions with the notch/home indicator
- Real touch targets and whether a control is actually reachable
- Gestures, scroll physics, rotation behaviour
- Anything where `usePillClearance` decides the layout

Grammar, wrapping and containment stay on `bun run test:ui` — it is seconds,
not minutes. See `WEB-PARITY.md` for the full division of labour.

`test/flows/seat-decisions.yaml` is the worked example: the device twin of
`scripts/verify-seat-decisions.mjs`, which can only ever run in a browser.
